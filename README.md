Prepare yourself to fend off an incoming alien invasion on the groovy Planet Shakeassion VII! 

Collect 8Beats, the currency of Shakeassion VII, from fallen enemies and use them to unlock new defenses. Your automated turrets produce unique sounds and fire on the beats, generating an ever evolving music loop.

Try deploying various turrets to defeat the different enemy types and experience more than 3000 combinations of rhythms and melodies, thus creating a soundtrack that is unique to your own in-game choices.

Don’t let too many invasors reach your base, or your game and music loop will be over... And, if you are wondering about the game's title, there is no 8-bit art or music in here. None. Whatsoever. Just some good old tower defense mechanics, combined with a musical loop theme and some kind of delirious story elements.

You can play 8BEATS using your mouse only. After you’re done playing, you can even download (and maybe share with the hashtag **#8beats**) the track of the last music loop you created!
